# Project 4: SPACE.


## Overview
Date-a-Base is a community aimed at entrepreneurs and student looking for space to work. It is a platform which enable users to find suitable venues to work based on various specifications. Users are able to comment on the posts and advise other users based on experiences. The repo can be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/Iamshola/project-04) and the depoloyed site can be viewed on [Heroku](https://github.com/Iamshola/project-04).

## Project Brief

### The following requirements:

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.
